Is My Volkswagen Passat PHEV Charging Too Slowly? Seeking Insights,"I’ve had my 2025 Volkswagen Passat plug-in hybrid (PHEV) for a couple of months now, and I specifically chose this model because of its 50 kW DC fast-charging capacity, thinking it would be great for road trips. However, when I take it to fast chargers rated at 300+ kW, the best charging speed I’ve ever seen is 15 kW—far below what I expected.

For context:
	•	Temperatures have been between 26°F and 46°F (-3°C to 8°C) since I got the car.
	•	I mostly use a home trickle charger (which works fine for daily use), but I’m concerned about road trips as the weather warms up.
	•	I’ve only used public fast chargers, not home DC charging.
	•	I know cold weather affects charging speeds, but this seems like an extreme reduction.

Is this kind of speed normal for winter conditions with a PHEV? Can I expect an improvement once the weather warms up? Are there settings, preconditioning steps, or other factors that could be affecting my charging speed? I’d appreciate any insights from other Passat PHEV owners or EV enthusiasts who’ve experienced similar issues!",RamMasterFlash84,1739608667.0,1,ElectricVehicles

Hertz EV Rental in LAX as a Foreigner,"Hi, I'm a foreigner who is going to LAX soon and by far, the cheapest option for Hertz car rental is the Intermediate Electric Elite (Polestar 2 or similar). I also just signed up for the Hertz Gold Reward free membership, if it changes anything. I also have never driven an EV.

Now I have read many reviews discouraging foreigners (especially ones new to EV) from renting EV as it can be a headache, from queuing up in charging stations, to broken chargers, to payment cards not working.

Questions:

1. I was wondering if I could still proceed to book this Intermediate Electric Elite option and then just ask them to change my car preference as I pick it up? Is this a ""perk"" of being a free gold member? Or will I still get up-charged?

2. I have also read that Teslas are a good starting point for EV beginners as it is more straightforward to use, such as at Tesla superchargers. If this is the case, would they allow me to switch to a Tesla? Or should I completely stop trying to rent an EV?

The US needs far more hybrid vehicles than pure BEVs,"The US is short 128gw of capacity for the next five years, caused by data centers and manufacturing.

It's not a given but it's possible that DCFC gets throttled in the next few years, changing the driving equation.  Both from power companies as well as by shared power for more chargers per location.

This did not pass but it shows recognition of a grid problem, that we can't get enough power to where people need it for dcfc.

[https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-tonko-introduce-ev-grid-act-meet-increasing-electricity-demand-ev](https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-tonko-introduce-ev-grid-act-meet-increasing-electricity-demand-ev)

**DCFC**

The demand for dcfc would be so big that current shortage is only 250kwh 365,714 DC fast chargers at once. With perfect change over (no one uses more than 30 minutes) only about 13.165 million vehicles could charge per day at that rate.

The US has 283.5 million vehicles, so you could charge every 21 days.    17 times per year

The average miles driven per year is about 14,500.   Requiring you to get 850 miles of range in 30 minutes only dc fast charging.

So to support 100% EVs using only dc fast charging the country needs about 500gigawatts of capacity just for EVs.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

So 100% dcfc seems unrealistic to get rid of gas vehicles on a 20 year timeline, if we assume they build that 128gw in the next five years

**L2**

If we switch to only 7.7kwh charging (30 @ 240) and people charge overnight mainly.

283.5 million cars would mostly be charged in two shifts of 8 hours each.  Home overnight and work during business hours. Very roughly this should account for overlap, fewer but longer sessions by some and weird schedules.  That's 141.75 million vehicles at once L2 charging.

For a BEV getting 60 miles each day would need to charge about 230 times per year per vehicle given 8 hours.   We basically need full capacity for 141.7 million vehicles at all times

That's 1091gigawatts of power needed

It's a lot higher due to more concurrent demand for longer in the day.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

**The problem**

The assumption of this is we cannot build that many fast chargers on any given timeframe.  It's easier to install slow chargers.

The average BEV range is about 300 miles.  Need to charge about 50 times a year, so once a week, if we could fast charge every week.

If we had perfect turnover and people that's a need for 15.75 million DC Fast chargers in the US, all  being used perfectly for 18 hours a day.  No idle time, someone is always waiting for you to end at every single one of them.  While that's not reasonable what does that require?

At $50k each that's $787,500,000,000 needed for chargers

NEVI is a $5 billion program for one year.  Even when running it's off by a factor of 150x.  We need to scale up charger funding to be over $35 billion every year for 20-years (to stay in line with potential generation scale up)

L2 chargers are cheaper, at an average of about $3500.  But needing one per every two vehicles it's only $495,950,000,000 in cost.  Still a lot of money.

The issue with going to an electric future isn't demand, it's electrical capacity and charger cost.

**Where Do We Put Them?**

About 2/3 of housing has a driveway.  Including all parking, only 48% have private parking.

Shared parking muddies things.  Imagine an apartment complex with 200 spots for 100 units.

People like to get a spot closest to their unit.  And what about guests?   The complex even adding 20 L2 chargers could cost be $1 million and they aren't going to be in the right places for anyone needing them.  They aren't going to be turned over well when people sit in the spot all night.   So long term will need more and more and more dedicated chargers.

Half the country is in a situation where charging is a pain.

The other half can charge overnight if they spend the money, and many can't.

Having a driveway doesn't mean their landlord will install one.  What if they need to upgrade the panel first?  About 30% of all homes have a 100 amp panel.

So even those who charge at home have problems to solve

So we need lots of public slow chargers and people today who don't want to pay the dcfc premium to be using them for many hours every day.

That 14500 miles is 39 per day.  Most people would be well served with a hybrid that can go 70-80 miles per full charge and charge nightly with grid management software determining when they need to be charged by.  You may be forced start at 1am, 3am or such to spread out demand.

**The answer?**

A slowdown in EV sales is coming as a result.  We aren't scaling up charging fast enough.  We're building out charging an order of magnitude slower than is needed.

The average car lasts 12.6 years.  That means half of all vehicles are over 13 years old.

A very rough estimate has 7% of cars on the road todays as EV in the US.

[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924)

The answer is we need far more plug in hybrid models on the market in the next decade.   We need to slow down dcfc electrical demand by shifting sales away from BEVs.

The rest of the world is already heading that way.  1/3 of cars in Europe are hybrids and in China hybrid sales doubled and phevs could have a larger market share in a few years.

The exact numbers vary by country.  It appears to depend on how far people drive.  Norway is small and compact and as a result fewer than 10% of new electric vehicles are hybrids.   The US is large and low density so I would expect hybrids dominate electric vehicle sales long-term.   Cities like NYC will rely on public charging so I expect those with cars choose hybrids to have options.

Legally enforceable 2nd life EV batteries for home power use?,"TLDR : Should EV manufacturers be legally obliged to make their EV batteries easily adaptable for home use?

Everyone recognises that, barring some rare exceptions, sooner or later cars get sold onwards in favour of a newer, better, bigger model or are so affected by some mechanical issue or trauma that they need to be scrapped.  In both these circumstances the resale value is often dramatically lower than ideal.  In many of these cases there will be a perfectly useful EV battery that, whilst no longer attractive to EV users due to lower range or charging speed, might serve as a fabulously capacious home battery solution, or part of one.

Looking around the internet it appears that this is utterly possible but comes with difficulties and roadblocks.  The biggest of all is the ability to communicate with and control the EV battery pack via its connections and components.  Each manufacturer has its way of doing things and often doesn't share the information.

Wouldn't it make sense if each manufacturer was legally required to publish such information and provide relevant software code so that EV batteries could be removed and repurposed easily within a domestic setting?

In a few years time I imagine my e-Niro being worth far less than its 64kWh battery would be if it were able to be used for a future home setup!  Some poor soul had to sell an old Kia for about £5000 despite the battery still being in decent shape. Even if at the end of it's useful vehicular life the battery has only 80% of its range and cannot charge anywhere close to the DC rate of newer vehicles it would be perfectly serviceable as a battery for the home, even capable of keeping a home going for a couple of days during a blackout in the winter.

A British gentleman on YouTube has actually done this with a Tesla EV battery pack.  Fair fxxxing play to the gent.  I don't think I have the technical chops to pull it off, so hopefully governments can step in and make it less scary to engage a professional to do it for me in the future.

I Feel Guilty For Owning A Tesla,"Sorry for the poor formatting and editing: I am writing this by phone

I started majoring in EECS at MIT in 2018 as a 17 year old boy and later graduated in 2022, having held 3 internships by then (an unpaid internship in 2017, a paid internship at a software company in 2019, and a FAANG internship in 2020). 

After graduation, I was thinking of taking a paid temporary software consulting position/business opportunity as an aspiring AI entrepreneur for Summer 2023 in California (it never happened) to experience living there. That fueled my obsession for a car. Also, I have been a car enthusiast since childhood and ever since I was 11 (before Elon Musk shifted right), I have dreamed of owning a Tesla. 

Since Spring of 2022, I have been intermittently working as a remote software consultant for several major tech companies whilst also working on my AI projects/research, and investing, mainly for financial stability, and that meant I have the money for a car for occasional cross country road trips, weekend tours around the Northeast of the US, and Doordashing as a hobby (for a purpose of going outside since I am mostly remote, outside the days where I meet in person, mostly for my tech startup).

Even though I had a drivers licence since 2019 (18 years old), owning a car is a liability where I live (given the off street parking price per month and the fact I would have to move my car very often if I was street parking), so I held back on owning a car (despite having at least a million in assets due to the Tesla stock boom in 2020-1).

Until Summer 2022.

In November 2021, I sold my stock (half the stock I owned was Tesla) just as recession fears started unraveling due to inflation. I poured in at least 75 thousand USD of my internship money for Tesla in October 2019, and I received a huge ROI.

Due to the fact Teslas were still overpriced as of August 2022 and Elon Musk's views started to shift towards the far right (I was already concerned about his lockdown views and move to Texas by then), I never considered a Tesla.

I was also turned down by used cars because used cars were overpriced (August 2022 was the peak), so I instead resorted to a new car. I looked towards a Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, and Hyundai Elantra, but then, when Tesla lowered the Model 3 prices, I still didn't consider Tesla due to the fact I wanted to wait and see what the Highland and Juniper offers.

I kept on bleating about the Hyundai Elantra (early 2023) until the Kona came out, and when the Volvo EX30 came out in June (I was in Milan the day before the EX30 was announced), I decided to switch my obsession towards Volvo. 

Funnily, my 75 year old father in Vietnam who is a prominent healthcare official and multi millionaire in Vietnam actually owns a Volvo XC40, which motivated me to switch my minds to a Volvo. Before 2021, he owned a slew of Mercedes Benz E Classes for 28 years ranging from the W124 to the W213. 

Even though the Tesla Model 3 has a proven track record compared with the Volvo EX30, in my mind, the Volvo has better build quality, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, includec safety and autonomous features such as auto park assist, etc, and is more manueverable as it is 165 inches in length and I live in Cambridge.

Then comes September 2023. The Tesla Model 3 Highland came out and by the time EX30 reviews came in Europe in November, I started slowly switching my minds back to the Tesla Model 3 as in my beliefs, the Highland is more likely to come out to the US before the EX30.

That is despite the fact Elon has gone further right and despite the fact I further despise Elon Musk for his unhingedness.

In January 2024, the Highland was released and based on my analysis, not much has changed, so I decided to go with a used Tesla due to me not qualifying for tax rebates/credits.

In June 2024, I upgraded my Scion XD (which is ageing and rusting) to a 2021 Tesla Model 3 for 25k and I chose Tesla for a few reasons:

In Cambridge, EV infrastructure is decent (my city offers municipal chargers which cost 20 cents per kwh and are half a mile away from my apartment). In my calculation, that is kind of like owning a 55 mpg Prius and using a $3 per gallon gas station 

I am also planning to move to another apartment soon, which meant I might be able to have an off street parking solution, which meant I might be able to use a Level 1 charger, which would further facilitate charging. That in turn makes charging cheaper than gas. I am also an environmentalist, so I support EVs, public transportation, and biking

When charging outside, using a Tesla Supercharger on a Tesla is cheaper than using a Tesla Supercharger whilst also having a dongle on a Ford/Rivian and having to pay a subscription. Tesla Supercharger price per kwh is also more affordable than Electrify America, Chargepoint, or EVGo

Tesla Model 3 has a more efficient watt hours per mile than other cars, further lessening the costs

The technology is better in some areas (say the infotainment OS) and worse in others

It is also easier to find a Model 3 than a Mach E/Ioniq 5/BMW i4/Polestar/Volvo XC40 recharge/EV6 (six of my runner ups) for under 25k

With all of this said, I bought a Tesla Model 3, and even though I love my Tesla (apart from a few issues), I feel kind of alienated from my Tesla, due to Elon's shift towards Nazi salutes, sabotaging the economy through DOGE, and being fully entrenched in the far right. He has even attempted to infiltrate into Germany's political system, trying to lobby for the AfD to win nationwide.

Elon's recent antics made me feel uncomfortable and it made me consider selling my Tesla at a loss, even if I really love the car.

I am just a frugal man. I don't want to bear the financial loss, be broke, and not have the money to funnel into my tech startup.

I am scared people might perceive me as a far right sympathizer for liking my Tesla. But the fact is, I despise fascism.

Also, I do understand that Henry Ford espoused some racist views, that VW/VAG was founded by Hitler, and that Toyota has become so anti environment.",MussleGeeYem,1739213842.0,0,ElectricVehicles

"I don't want EVs to start coming in with NACS port natively. Other networks are getting more reliable, better speeds and even better amenities.","The NACS - mania that started with Ford getting supercharger access and then kept rolling until every brand, except for a few major luxury ones have committed to NACS.

Here's my dislike issues for NACS, specifically for NACS Tesla superchargers.

1. Not enough voltage. For EVs from Hyundai, Kia, GM high end vehicles, Lucid and even a few German luxury brands. High pack voltage EVs have to use a small onboard booster, this makes even the fastest charging EV a charging lemon at a supercharger.

2. Not enough current. EVs with very low pack voltage, similar to equinox, blazer, prologue need higher currents to charge faster at lower voltages. Superchargers suck at it. Ironically, a Chevy Equinox will charge faster at a 350kw station rated for 500 amps, than at a 150kw station, because of higher current ratings.

3. Tesla will solve the problem with V4 advocates. How long before all the superchargers that are either V3/V3.5 and open to non-Tesla EVs actually get upgraded to proper V4 - with the 4th Gen dispenser and 4th Gen cabinets, to support 1000V at 600A, as stated by Tesla Charging? We don't know. I say, not anytime before 2030.

4. Other Networks are slow to install NACS. This means that your EV capable of charging at high speeds can't charge at high speeds with your chargeport and the networks capable of charging at high speeds don't go into your chargeport. Ioniq5 2025 and Lucid gravity owners have to carry around charging adapters so that they can access networks that would otherwise have been capable of charging their cars without one, at the speeds their cars are designed for.

5. CCS is more capable than you know. There has been testing that shows that CCS can support up to 990kw charging speed, essentially megawatt charging. Future 2500s, 3500s and semi trucks can easily charge on an already established supply network for a charging port. NACS doesn't have that capability.

Let's show CCS some love, because it was tarnished by the bad charging networks, despite it being far more superior. ",Ok-Pea3414,1739165882.0,0,ElectricVehicles
"Would you be a 2 EV household with a long commute, or 1 EV and 1 ICE?","My wife has a once weekly 180 mile round trip commute.  Drives about 80-120 miles round trip 2-3 times a week.  I WFH full time.  We definitely need two cars available.

She's been driving an ICE Macan but we got a used OG Etron a couple months ago which has been excellent, was affordable, and is inexpensive to charge.  Trouble is, especially with winter temps 25-35f, it absolutely cannot make the 180 mile round trip w/out charging, something which I hadn't thought about.  There's one EA 350kW station at the halfway point but sometimes the working chargers are full (and people like to spend 40 minutes charging to 100% for some reason) and so what should be a 10 minute stop could be as long as an hour. Crummy way to end a long day.

I'd been planning to get a 2nd EV-- it does seem like some of the affordable used '21 or '22 AWD EVs could make that commute in winter (Not a fan of RWD ICE cars in freezing/snow conditions even w/ good tires).  What would you do, hang onto your ICE car or go full EV?

EDIT: Perhaps not surprisingly on an EV forum, most folks would go with 2 EVs.  However, running the numbers with a minimum mileage (lets be conservative and say 1 trip per week, 40 weeks a year-- in reality it would be more), keeping an existing good vehicle is financially the winner (when purchasing-- I didn't calculate for a lease).  The biggest factors are purchase price and sale price of the existing vehicle.  Efficiency, insurance costs, etc make relatively small differences (this analysis does not include residual value of the vehicle after 5 years).  Of course this analysis would be different if your existing vehicle needs major service or is near EOL.  Note: the tax includes incentives fed/state that won't apply to most readers

[Spreadsheet for 1 trip per week, 40 weeks per year, with some buffer added](https://preview.redd.it/8eqqecj2bdie1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0f5695543a0b56e43049e1d99d927e16ea8b292)

For comparison, let's assume my wife's employer mandates 3 days a week onsite (which seems to be the current trend).  In this case, an affordable used EV absolutely KOs the ICE vehicle.

Building a 1 seater electric vehicle,"Does anyone think a 1 seater, enclosed electric vehicle could be used? I'm building one since I think electric mobility should be efficient and envoyermetally friendly.

They are wasteful and stupid. 
I'm building a 1 seater, super aerodinamic electric vehicle. The vehicle weight should be around 200kg and use between 30/50 watt per km. 
Cars are used mostly by just one person so wh not have a super efficient and economical electric vehicle that does jus that. And when needs a car can rent one or own a car but not trash it in day to day use and keep it in good condition. But I think for the future an efficient renting scheme should be better this way one rent the vehicle type he need for that situation.

Electric vehicle Tax Credit Issue,"

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a frustrating experience so others don’t fall into the same trap. I purchased a Ford Lightning from Diamond Ford in Lancaster, CA, in August 2024. When I asked about the EV tax credit, the finance manager told me that all I had to do was input the vehicle information when filing my taxes — no action needed from the dealership.

Fast forward to tax season, and my return was rejected because of the EV credit. Turns out the dealership is required to submit a clean vehicle report to the IRS at the point of sale. When I contacted Diamond Ford, they flat-out refused, saying “they don’t do that.” I was completely misled.

I did extensive research on buying the vehicle, looked through forums, and saw no mention of needing to ensure the dealer submits anything at the time of purchase. When I contacted Ford corporate today, the representative seemed clueless about the issue and referenced the outdated 30D form used for 2023. All they did was create a complaint case and say they’d contact the dealership’s sales manager. I also contacted the dealership and they refused to even try and submit it. I’m aware it’s past the point of sale. Apparently someone on another post did have success even though they filed late. 

Bottom line: if you’re considering buying an EV, do NOT buy from Diamond Ford in Lancaster, CA. You might miss out on a $7,500 tax credit because they refuse to do their part.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Any advice on getting this resolved would be appreciated.",mlcyz125,1738963400.0,13,ElectricVehicles
